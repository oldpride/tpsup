REM batch script doesn't have a $# equivalent. the following script is the best so far
set argC=0
for %%x in (%*) do Set /A argC+=1
REM echo %argC%


REM batch script has no != operator. use NOT == instead
REM echo. is to print a blank line
if %argC% == 0 (
   echo ERROR:   wrong number of args. got %argC%, expected 1. args=%*
   echo usage:   
   echo.    
   echo    cmd.exe:        pkill     pattern
   echo                    pkill     chromedriver
   echo.
   echo    cygwin/gitbash: pkill.cmd pattern
   echo                    pkill.cmd chromedriver
   echo.
   echo    This script kills child processes too. 
   echo    For example, "pkill chromedriver" will kill also chrome.exe sprawned by chromedriver.

rem
rem    You can use almost any character as a delimiter, but they are case sensitive.
rem    If you don't specify delims it will default to "delims=<tab><space>"
rem 
rem    delims should always the last item in the options string "tokens=3 delims= " not "delims=  tokens=3"
rem    This is because the quotations around the options string do double duty as a terminator for the
rem    delims character(s), which is particularly important when that character is a space.
rem 
rem    You can remove all delimiters by using "delims=" this will place everything on the line into the
rem    first token.
rem 
rem    One special case is using a quote (") as delimiter.
rem    By default this will be seen as the end of the "delims string" unless all the outer enclosing
rem    quotes are removed and all delimiter chars are instead escaped with ^.
rem
rem    Each token specified will cause a corresponding parameter letter to be allocated. The letters used
rem    for tokens are case sensitive.
rem 
rem    If the last character in the tokens= string is an asterisk, then additional parameters are 
rem    allocated for all the remaining text on the line.
rem    therefore, if you start with letter %%p, then next token will go to %%q, and then %%r
