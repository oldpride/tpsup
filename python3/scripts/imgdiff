# this wrapper script created (copied) by tpsup/scripts/cmd_maker.bash
# example usage see tpsup/python3/scripts/Makefile
# the original script is tpsup/scripts/cmd_generic.bash.
# tpsup/scripts/cmd_maker.bash will copy tpsup/scripts/cmd_generic.bash to target's directory
# and rename it to <target>

# this wrapper is to shorten command line, so that instead of
#    python ptgrep_cmd.py ...
# we can type
#    ptgrep ...
# to archive this, we could have used symbolic link
# however: symbolic link doesn't work well on windows, cygwin or gitbash.
#          therefore, we had to use hard copy. see Makefile in this folder.

# use double quotes to enclose path so that path like /c/Program Files/... will be protected
